[![Project Status: Active The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itsrainingdata/sparsebn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itsrainingdata/sparsebn) [![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/sparsebn)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/sparsebn) [![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/sparsebn)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/sparsebn)

Introducing `sparsebn`: A new R package for learning sparse Bayesian networks and other graphical models from high-dimensional data via sparse regularization. Designed from the ground up to handle:

-   Experimental data with interventions
-   Mixed observational / experimental data
-   High-dimensional data with *p &gt;&gt; n*
-   Datasets with thousands of variables (tested up to *p*=8000)
-   Continuous and discrete data

The emphasis of this package is scalability and statistical consistency on high-dimensional datasets. Compared to existing algorithms, `sparsebn` scales much better and is under active development. For more details on this package, including worked examples and the methodological background, please see [our new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04025) \[[1](#references)\].

Overview
--------

The main methods for learning graphical models are:

-   `estimate.dag` for directed acyclic graphs (Bayesian networks).
-   `estimate.precision` for undirected graphs (Markov random fields).
-   `estimate.covariance` for covariance matrices.

Currently, estimation of precision and covariances matrices is limited to Gaussian data.

The workhorse behind [`sparsebn`](http://www.github.com/itsrainingdata/sparsebn/) is the [`sparsebnUtils`](http://www.github.com/itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/) package, which provides various S3 classes and methods for representing and manipulating graphs. The basic algorithms are implemented in [`ccdrAlgorithm`](http://www.github.com/itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/) and [`discretecdAlgorithm`](http://www.github.com/gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm/).

Installation
------------

You can install:

-   the latest CRAN version with

    ``` r
    install.packages("sparsebn")
    ```

-   the latest development version from GitHub with

    ``` r
    devtools::install_github(c("itsrainingdata/sparsebn/", "itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/dev", "itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/dev", "gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm"))
    ```
