Introducing `sparsebn`: A new R package for learning sparse Bayesian
networks and other graphical models from high-dimensional data via
sparse regularization. Designed from the ground up to handle:

-   Experimental data with interventions
-   Mixed observational / experimental data
-   High-dimensional data with *p &gt;&gt; n*
-   Datasets with thousands of variables (tested up to *p*=8000)
-   Continuous and discrete data

The emphasis of this package is scalability and statistical consistency
on high-dimensional datasets. Compared to existing algorithms,
`sparsebn` scales much better and is under active development. For more
details on this package, including worked examples and the
methodological background, please see [our new
preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04025) \[[1](#references)\].

Overview
--------

The main methods for learning graphical models are:

-   `estimate.dag` for directed acyclic graphs (Bayesian networks).
-   `estimate.precision` for undirected graphs (Markov random fields).
-   `estimate.covariance` for covariance matrices.

Currently, estimation of precision and covariances matrices is limited
to Gaussian data.

The workhorse behind
[`sparsebn`](https://github.com/itsrainingdata/sparsebn/) is the
[`sparsebnUtils`](https://github.com/itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/)
package, which provides various S3 classes and methods for representing
and manipulating graphs. The basic algorithms are implemented in
[`ccdrAlgorithm`](https://github.com/itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/) and
[`discretecdAlgorithm`](https://github.com/gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm/).

Installation
------------

You can install:

-   the latest CRAN version with

    ``` r
    install.packages("sparsebn")
    ```

-   the latest development version from GitHub with

    ``` r
    devtools::install_github(c("itsrainingdata/sparsebn/", "itsrainingdata/sparsebnUtils/dev", "itsrainingdata/ccdrAlgorithm/dev", "gujyjean/discretecdAlgorithm"))
    ```
